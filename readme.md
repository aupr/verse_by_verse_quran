The aim of this small web-app is to benifit those who are committed to memorize  quran by heart. Sometimes, its important to be attentive the same verse again and again. There are some mobile apps those are very good to use for this motivation. However, not enough work has done based on web that might allow us to select a range of verses and listen  repeatedly. Alhamdulillah, this app shall allow us to select a range from a surah. I hope this work shall be a small contribution to memorize The Holy Quran.
